Zachary McCarthy, you have pleaded guilty before me on indictment, to one charge of aggravated burglary and one charge of causing serious injury recklessly. 
The offending is serious and that is reflected in the maximum penalty prescribed by law and that is 25 years' imprisonment in respect of the aggravated burglary charge and 15 years' imprisonment in respect to the recklessly causing serious injury charge. 
I will now proceed to sentence you on the basis of the Crown opening that was read at the plea hearing and has been exhibited. 
You were 25 years at the time of the offending and you are relatively youthful. 
I will briefly refer to the circumstances of the charge. 
The incident occurred on Tuesday 31 January 2017. 
Both you and a coJames, are friends. 
You had been drinking together that day into the evening. 
You were drinking alcohol mixed with Serepax. 
You were both intoxicated at the time of the offending. 
You had been drinking in the company with your respective girlfriends, namely Taylor Blacker and Ebony Graham. 
Apparently you had sold a vehicle to Robert Harrison, the complainant in Charge 2. 
He is aged 19. 
You were in a dispute with him about the agreement and during the course of the evening, you and Twentyman discussed going together to see Harrison to retrieve the car keys from him. 
At the time Twentyman was in possession of a small folding Gerber knife and during the course of the day, you had been playing with the knife and you told Twentyman that you would hold on to it. 
Later in the evening the two of you began to walk towards the unit where Robert Harrison was staying. 
He was living there with his sister Lauren. 
You walked towards the unit in company with your respective girlfriends. 
Unbeknown to you, Robert Harrison and another friend Nathan Voyce, who had been staying at the unit, were out at a nearby supermarket. 
When you first arrived and tried to enter the unit, Robert's older sister Lauren Harrison was asleep in an upstairs bedroom of that unit. 
It was about midnight and you and Twentyman approached the front door and banged on the door. 
Lauren Harrison heard the noise but ignored it. 
You then both forcibly gained entry by breaking the doorframe on the rear back door. 
When you entered the premises you were in possession of the Gerber knife. 
I noted that you were known to all of the people involved in this incident. 
Charge 1 aggravated burglary is put on the basis that you were armed with the knife and entered the unit with the intention to assault a person. 
On entry you both went upstairs to the bedroom area and as you were climbing the stairs, your friend Twentyman called out, "Is anyone home?" 
Msrecognised his voice. 
You then both entered MsHarrison's bedroom and turned on the light. 
Lauren Harrison saw Twentyman and then heard him say, "Where's the money?" 
Lauren got out of bed and pushed past the two of you into the hallway. 
As she neared the staircase you swore at her and kicked her in the back, causing her to fall part way down the stairs before she caught herself. 
She then ran down the stairs followed by both you and McCarthy. 
She reached the front door and opened it and as she exited, she saw one of you two grab her television and throw it to the floor. 
Those facts constitute Charge 1 aggravated burglary. 
As she exited the unit, Robert Harrison and Nathan Voyce were nearly home, having returned from the supermarket. 
She yelled out to them as you two ran from her unit into the driveway. 
McCarthy, you started fighting with Robert Harrison and Nathan Voyce in the driveway. 
During that fight you stabbed Robert Harrison once to the lower back region causing his spleen to rupture. 
He suffered serious injury and was in a coma for several days, and that constitutes Charge 2 recklessly cause serious injury. 
After Robert Harrison had been stabbed and was lying on the ground, McCarthy, you were heard to say these words:  "I want my keys back". 
Mssaw you holding the knife that had blood on it. 
At this point you turned and started to assault Mrce. 
You pushed him up against the wall and held the knife to his throat. 
All the while MrHarrison was yelling, "I've been stabbed". 
MrTwentyman then placed himself between you and Mrce and attempted to disarm you. 
A fight then ensued between you and Twentyman and Voyce. 
Twentyman managed to punch you and disarm you. 
In the course of the scuffle when he sought to intervene and disarm you, he suffered a defensive wound, namely a laceration to one of his hands caused by the blade of the knife. 
You then punched Mrbefore walking away. 
Police eventually attended the scene and arrested you. 
You were a short distance away from the driveway. 
Police located the small black folding knife nearby. 
It was exposed, the blade, and it appeared to have blood upon it. 
The impact of your offending, Mrhas been very serious. 
Mrsuffered a stab wound to the left interior lateral aspect of his chest and back at the superior aspect of his flank. 
He underwent an emergency laparotomy for splenic injury. 
The stab wound caused potentially lifeinjuries and without swift surgical intervention, it could have led to his death through catastrophic bleeding. 
When interviewed you admitted attending the premises with Twentyman in order to retrieve the set of keys relating to the vehicle. 
You also admitted possessing the knife and entering the unit and confronting MsHarrison. 
You admitted to being in possession of the knife at the time Mrwas stabbed and you told police that you must have stabbed him. 
It is accepted by prosecution that Twentyman is in no way responsible for the injuries to Mr This offending, particularly the stabbing, is a serious example of this offence. 
The aggravated burglary is also a serious example of that offence. 
Two men forcibly entering a unit in the early hours of the morning, in company, and confronting a lone person while she was asleep in bed would have been terrifying for her, and thereafter you stabbed Mrcausing serious injury. 
In sentencing you, there is a need for the court to emphasise denunciation and on behalf of the community, I condemn your behaviour. 
There is also a need to emphasise both general and specific deterrence and to provide for the protection of the community in the future. 
Victim impact statements were declared by Lauren Harrison and by Rachel Kirby, the mother of Robert Harrison. 
Lauren Harrison described her feelings of violation and ongoing problems with anxiety, depression and fear. 
She was upset about sofriends behaving in this manner. 
She experiences problems with feeling insecure in her own home and lives in constant fear. 
She has ongoing symptoms of poststress disorder, including sleeping problems, rumination and nightmares, depression and anxiety. 
She is hyper vigilant and reacts in an aroused way whenever anyone knocks at her door. 
She feels guilty that she was unable to protect her little brother from injury. 
She stated that the incident has affected her dramatically in all areas and she hates how her life has become and how her trust of other people has been broken. 
Mschel Kirby, Robert Harrison's mother, set out the impact that the offending has had upon her upon immediately being notified that her son had been stabbed. 
She described her anguish and her fear that she would lose her son. 
Fortunately, he has survived and made a good recovery with counselling. 
She states that he is now working. 
She says however he has dropped all his friends, except for Nathan Voyce and he that has now become very withdrawn and insular. 
He suffers severe anxiety and has trouble sleeping and he too has issues with trust. 
Given the circumstances, all of those impacts are very understandable. 
Rachel Kirby also described her depression and the toll that the incident has taken upon all of her family. 
Her life changed forever through your one senseless act of violence. 
I shall now turn to matters personal to you. 
You are 25 years of age and you are a roof tiler by occupation. 
You admitted your prior criminal history. 
Of particular relevance, you were convicted at Geelong Magistrates' Court on 13 April 2012, when you were aged 19, for a charge of recklessly cause serious injury, unlawful assault and possess and use drug of dependence for which offences you received a sentence of six months detention in a Youth Training Centre. 
The circumstances of the recklessly cause serious injury charge echo the circumstances of this case and are very concerning. 
You were involved in an argument involving your girlfriend and your girlfriend's brother. 
Whilst fighting with the girlfriend's brother, you removed a knife from your pocket and stabbed him twice in the back. 
He suffered puncture wounds to the lower right side of his back and upper right side of his back. 
In the circumstances of that case, when you were interviewed by police you said that offending occurred in the context of you having taken two or three Xanax tablets and that your recall of the incident was limited due to your intoxicated state and unfortunately, that reflects again the circumstances of this current offending. 
I have taken into account the context of the offending and accept that you were heavily under the influence of both alcohol and Serepax at the time this offending occurred. 
Whilst explaining why it is that you engaged in this sort of behaviour on this occasion, it in no way excuses your behaviour. 
You had already been previously dealt with by the courts for offending that occurred in not dissimilar circumstances, that is resorting to using a knife, stabbing a person whilst intoxicated and under the influence of drugs. 
You ought to have known the link between your propensity for violence when you have abused drugs and in an intoxicated state. 
I consider your moral culpability to be high and there is a real need to emphasise both general and specific deterrence and the protection of the community from you in the sentencing. 
I note that you have also had appearances in the Children's Court for burglary and other dishonesty type offences in 2008 and 2009. 
You have been on remand since the offending and you are currently held at the Albion mainstream unit at Port Phillip Prison where you work as the unit billet. 
You are the eldest of three children. 
You grew up amongst an extended family that included your grandmother and yours was a difficult background. 
Your mother, MsMcCarthy gave evidence at the plea hearing. 
She described the difficulties she's had in her relationship with your father, her former husband. 
Your parents separated when you were eight, due to your father's violence and following separation, all three children of the marriage remained with him whilst your mother went to live in Castlemaine. 
She did however continue to have regular contact with all of her children and saw you all once a week. 
She described your father's relationship with you as being one characterised as being very violent and a controlling one. 
He died recently following a heart attack about five months ago whilst travelling in Cambodia. 
As you grew older the physical abuse continued and you would both physically fight each other. 
I have also had regard to a recent disclosure from you that you were sexually abused as a young child by an older cousin and you were touched inappropriately over five years between the ages of six and eleven and you have never, ever sought any treatment or counselling in respect to that. 
Because of the difficulties that you experienced in the home setting, you left the family home when you were aged only 15 and went and lived with your grandmother. 
You completed Year 10 at Oberon high school and then went on to commence but did not complete a bricklaying apprenticeship, a butchery apprenticeship and a baker's apprenticeship. 
Your last employment was as a roof tiler and you have a Certificate III in roof tiling. 
Unfortunately your work ceased in March 2016 following a workplace injury. 
You suffered a hearing loss when you were exposed to an explosive device that caused you to suffer a 50 per cent bilateral hearing loss which rendered you unfit for work as a roof tiler. 
You are currently in a relationship with MsBlake with whom you have a 2 year old son. 
She also has a 4 year old son whom you treat as if he were your child. 
She was present at the plea hearing and remains supportive of you. 
She is regularly visiting you whilst you are in prison. 
The relationship is described as being a stable one and ongoing. 
You have had a lengthy history of polysubstance abuse. 
You started drinking alcohol when you were only 14, drinking to dangerous levels, several days a week. 
Around 15 you started using cannabis, amphetamines, methylamphetamines and Xanax and you used drugs and alcohol to forget your problems and make you feel happy. 
You were interviewed by David Ball, a psychologist, whose report of 28 September 2017 was provided at the plea hearing. 
He found no evidence of frank mental illness. 
He considered that you reported symptoms consistent with posttraumatic stress disorder, including nightmares, hypervigilance, exaggerated startled response which was linked to abuse, including sexual abuse that you were subjected to during your childhood. 
He could find no evidence of cognitive impairment and estimated your IQ to fall within the normal range. 
He diagnosed poststress disorder and severe benzodiazepine cannabis stimulant and alcohol use disorder in remission in a controlled environment. 
When interviewed by Mryou acknowledged the negative impacts of your substance abuse on your life, including your physical and mental health. 
In the past you have had some community based counselling and found it to be of assistance but you stated to Mrthat it was not frequent enough. 
You indicated to him your willingness to participate in further drug and alcohol counselling. 
You told Mrthat you had no recollection of the events, the subject of these charges and you had been affected by abusing Serepax and alcohol that night. 
You expressed regret and remorse to him concerning the offending. 
You said and I quote, "I'm sorry and I hope one day that they (the victims) can forgive me, that's not me or who I am." 
MrBall recommends that you would benefit from treatment aimed at addressing your conditions and also treatment, including supervision and support in the community. 
I urge the correctional authorities to have regard to the contents of his report which will be provided. 
Recently you have been provided medications for depression. 
MrVines on your behalf highlighted factors in mitigation, which I accept. 
You are still relatively youthful being 25 years of age and your rehabilitation therefore is an important sentencing consideration and having regard to the seriousness of the particular offending for which you are to receive a sentence, general and specific deterrence and protection of the community loom large in this exercise. 
He emphasised your early plea of guilty entered at committal mention. 
I accept that the plea was at the earliest opportunity and has real utility. 
You spared the State the expense and necessity of both committal hearing and a trial and importantly there was no crossexamination of any of the witnesses. 
In the particular circumstances of this case, that is important, given it would have been very traumatic for either the complainant, Robert Harrison or his sister Lauren to give evidence in this trial. 
You have facilitated justice and your sentence will be discounted accordingly. 
I do accept the plea is indicative of some remorse on your behalf. 
I have also had regard to the written apology that you have provided to me and all the victims. 
I note that you make no excuses for your actions and you are deeply sorry to your victims and the families and you acknowledge that you deserve to be punished in respect to the hurt that you have occasioned to the victims and their families. 
You say that there is not a day that goes by where you do not feel regret for what you have done. 
Because of a stupid decision you are missing out on seeing your children grow up and you do not blame anyone but yourself for that. 
You say that on remand you have done a range of courses, one of them being oneone therapy which has helped you in so many ways, one of which is dealing with some of the traumatic things that have happened to you as a child and the anger that you have as a consequence. 
You state that you consider that you have made real progress towards your rehabilitation. 
You hope one day that Robert, Lauren and Nathan can forgive you for your actions. 
You know that that is asking a lot of them, but you have come to learn that forgiveness is very important and that also means forgiving yourself which you are in the process of experiencing. 
You describe being in a good place physically and emotionally and you state that the sentence to be handed down will be one of the last hurdles on the road to rebuilding your life and you express again your true sorrow for what you have done and the hurt that you have occasioned to all of the victims. 
I have had regard to that apology and I do consider that you are genuinely remorseful and you have had a real opportunity now to reflect on your behaviour. 
I have had regard to your childhood history of abuse and deprivation which has had an ongoing negative impact upon you and that has continued, despite further serious offending. 
Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37. 
Your postoffence conduct does reflect well upon you. 
You are working productively as a billet. 
There was evidence of negative drug screens and you are now drug free, but that is in the context of a controlled environment in the prison. 
Of significance, you have already undergone some counselling and treatment in order to help you identify the reasons for your underlying offending behaviour and you are committed to further treatment in the future. 
Overall, I do consider that you have good prospects for rehabilitation, provided that you can maintain your abstinence and be supported in the community with treatment aimed at your posttraumatic stress disorder, drug and alcohol problems and other offending behaviour, including anger management. 
You require supports in the future to direct you to appropriate employment options, having regard to your hearing disability. 
I have had regard to the principles of totality and also the need to avoid a crushing sentence. 
Mron your behalf properly conceded that the only disposition available to the court was an immediate term of imprisonment to be imposed. 
Mr Maguire, on behalf of the Crown, highlighted the serious nature of your offending and submitted that both the aggravated burglary charge and recklessly cause serious injury charge are serious examples of these serious offences. 
He highlighted the violence and confrontation that occurred in the context of the aggravated burglary and that the fact that you were in company and that you entered the unit when it was believed there was a person present. 
The mode of entry was forced and there was a real confrontation with MsHarrison in her bedroom and thereafter you were violent towards her in the manner that was described in the opening. 
All of those factors combined, it would have been a terrifying experience for her. 
He emphasised just punishment, general and specific deterrence, denunciation and protection of the community were primary sentencing considerations. 
He submitted the recklessly causing serious injury charge was a serious example of this offence and that the aggravated burglary charge was in the midof offending. 
I agree with all of that but I consider the aggravated burglary charge to be in the upper range of mid-level offending. 
I will now proceed to sentence you. 
I omitted to say that I have had regard to the letter written on your behalf by DrBradshaw and that is another factor that I took into account in terms of your rehabilitation. 
Could you please stand now Mr In respect to Charge 1 the aggravated burglary, you will be convicted and sentenced to 4 years' imprisonment, and Charge, the recklessly cause serious injury, you will be convicted and sentenced to 5 years' imprisonment. 
I make an order for cumulation. 
I order that one year of the sentence imposed on Charge 1 be cumulative upon the sentence imposed on Charge 2, making a total effective sentence of 6 years' imprisonment. 
I fix a nonperiod of 4 years. 
I make a declaration pursuant to s.6AAA but for your pleas of guilty I would have imposed a sentence of eight years to serve six years. 
Predetention I have got 385 days. 
MR MAGUIRE:  Correct. 
MR VINES:  Yes, Your Honour. 
HER HONOUR:  I make a declaration of predetention. 
I declare that you have served 385 days of the sentence imposed and direct that that be entered into the records of the court. 
Finally I make the disposal orders sought. 
Have those disposal orders been provided? 
MR MAGUIRE:  Yes, Your Honour. 
HER HONOUR:  Have we got them? 
Okay, they will be printed out and I will sign them and my associate will provide them to your instructor. 
COUNSEL:  If Your Honour pleases. 
HER HONOUR:  Yes, thank you.
