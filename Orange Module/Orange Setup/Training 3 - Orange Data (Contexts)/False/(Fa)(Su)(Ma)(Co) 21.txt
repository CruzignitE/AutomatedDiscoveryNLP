I have also had regard to a recent disclosure from you that you were sexually abused as a young child by an older cousin and you were touched inappropriately over five years between the ages of six and eleven and you have never, ever sought any treatment or counselling in respect to that.
including sexual abuse that you were subjected to during your childhood.
